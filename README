## Installation

### 1. Backend Setup (Django REST Framework)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd lems
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    * *Linux/macOS:*
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv env
        source env/bin/activate
        ```
    * *Windows:*
        ```bash
        python -m venv env
        env\Scripts\activate
        ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Apply database migrations:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

5.  **Create a superuser (Admin account):**
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

6.  **Start Django server:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
    *The API will be running at `http://localhost:8000`.*

### 2. Frontend Setup (React)

1.  **Navigate to the frontend folder:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start React development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    *Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.*

---

## Usage

* **Admin:** Log in to the Admin dashboard to create, manage, and approve events, view RSVP statistics, and export attendee data.
* **Registered User:** Browse events, log in, and click "RSVP" to secure your spot. Use the personal dashboard to track and cancel existing RSVPs.
* **Non-Registered User:** Receive a secure invitation link via email or external channel. Click the link to RSVP directly without needing an account.

---

## Database Design

The system employs a relational structure to link events, users, and RSVPs securely.

* **`User`**: Registered user accounts.
* **`Event`**: Core event details (title, dates, location, max attendees, price).
* **`RSVP`**: Core linking table for attendance.
    * *Links a `User` **or** a token/email to an `Event`.*
* **`EventCategory`**: Optional tags for event organization.
* **`Ticket/Payment`**: Future table for paid transaction details.

> **Conceptual Relationships:**
> * **Event ↔ RSVP:** One-to-Many (1:N)
> * **User ↔ RSVP:** One-to-Many (1:N, nullable for non-registered users)
> * **Event ↔ EventCategory:** One-to-Many (1:N)
> * **Event ↔ Ticket/Payment:** One-to-Many (1:N, future implementation)

## Non-Functional Requirements

* **Performance:** The system must be able to handle **1000+ concurrent users** during peak event registration periods.
* **Security:** Implementation of **JWT** for API authentication, **token-based RSVPs** for security, hashed passwords, and future secure handling of payment data.
* **Usability:** Responsive, intuitive UI/UX built with React and Tailwind CSS.
* **Maintainability:** Backend structured into modular Django applications (e.g., `events`, `users`, `rsvps`, `notifications`) for clean separation of concerns.
* **Scalability:** Ready for future payment gateway integration and deployment on scalable cloud infrastructure.

---

## Future Enhancements

* **Paid Events:** Full implementation of paid events and complex ticketing logic.
* **Payment Gateways:** Integration with major payment providers (**Stripe / PayPal**) or local gateways.
* **Calendar Integration:** iCal/Google Calendar export for events.
* **Guest Checkout:** Seamless checkout process for non-registered users for paid events.
