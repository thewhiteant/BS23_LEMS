## Introduction

**LEMS** (Local Event Management System) is a modern web-based system to efficiently manage local events.  
The system enables admins to create and manage events, users to RSVP and track attendance, and optionally, in the future, to purchase paid event tickets.

### Purpose

- Simplify event creation and management.
- Track RSVPs and attendance.
- Prepare for optional paid event functionality.

### Scope

- Event creation, management, and approval workflow for admins.
- RSVP tracking for registered and non-registered users.
- Admin and user dashboards.
- Email notifications for RSVP confirmation and event reminders (via Celery).
- Optional future features: paid events, ticket types, payment gateway integration.

- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL / SQLite
- **Email:** SMTP / Celery for asynchronous tasks
- **Future:** Stripe / PayPal / local payment gateways

## Installation

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd lems
```
````

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
env\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Apply database migrations:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

5. Create a superuser (admin):

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

6. Start Django server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend folder:

```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start React development server:

```bash
npm start
```

4. Access the app at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

- **Admin:** create events, view RSVPs, export CSV.
- **Registered User:** view events, RSVP, manage your RSVPs.
- **Non-Registered User:** RSVP via secure token link.

---

## Database Design

- **User**: Registered users
- **Event**: title, description, date/time, location, max attendees, optional price
- **RSVP**: links User or token/email to Event
- **EventCategory**: optional categories/tags
- **Ticket/Payment**: future implementation for paid events

**Relationships:**

- Event ↔ RSVP (1:N)
- User ↔ RSVP (1:N, nullable for non-registered users)
- Event ↔ EventCategory (1:N)
- Event ↔ Ticket/Payment (1:N future)

## Functional Requirements (MVP + Future)

- Admin: CRUD events, view RSVPs, export CSV, manage pricing/tickets (future)
- Users: register/login, view events, RSVP, cancel RSVP, pay for tickets (future)
- Non-Registered Users: RSVP via secure token link, pay via token (future)
- Notifications: RSVP confirmation, reminder emails, ticket emails (future, via Celery)
- Reporting/Dashboard: Admin & user dashboards with RSVP stats

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Performance: handle 1000+ concurrent users
- Security: JWT authentication, token-based RSVPs, hashed passwords, secure payment fields
- Usability: responsive, intuitive UI, notifications
- Maintainability: modular Django apps (events, users, RSVPs, notifications, payments)
- Scalability: future payment integration, multi-language support, mobile app ready

---

## Future Enhancements

- Paid events and ticketing
- Payment gateways (Stripe / PayPal / local)
- Event calendar integration
- Guest checkout for paid events
- Mobile app support
